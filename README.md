# 3DinfoCPI

A Pytorch Implementation of paper:
**3DInforCPI:Enhancing Compound-Protein Interaction Prediction Efficiency through Novel Perspectives on 3D Information Integration**

Our reposistory uses 3DInformax from https://github.com/HannesStark/3DInfomax as a backbone for pretraining PNA for compound information extraction and ESM_Fold from https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm for predicting protein fold to access amtomic-level information from protein. We highly recommend researchers read the paper D-MPNN to better understand how it was used.
